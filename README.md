# Learn-React

## Brief Description of the repository

    This repository will contain everything that I used to learn React

# 1. React Tutorial for Beginners (by Mosh)

## Brief Description

    Folder name: react-app-mosh
    React Environment: vite@4.1.0
    Github: https://github.com/RemainAplomb
    Tutorial by: Programming with Mosh
    Retrieved from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk

## React Environment (Environment already in this repository)

```
npm create vite@4.1.0
```

You can name the environment whatever you want.
However, in my case, I named it react-app-mosh

But please note, that for the environment option,
it needs to be React -> Typescript

## Go to React Environment

Navigate to the react folder

```
cd react-app-mosh
```
